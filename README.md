# Multi-Objective Optimization Experiments for the W-EAM System

This repository contains the procedures to replicate the experiments presented in the paper:

**"On the Multi-objective Hyperparameter Optimization of the Weighted Entropic Associative Memory"**

**Authors:**  
- Juan Antonio Lopez Rivera  
- Carlos Ignacio Hernandez Castellanos  
- Rafael Morales  
- Luis A. Pineda Cortes  

The code was written in **Python 3**, using the **Anaconda Distribution**, and was run on two computers:

**Desktop computer:**  
- CPU: Intel Core i7-6700 @ 3.40 GHz  
- GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080  
- OS: Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial  
- RAM: 64 GB  

**Server:**  
- CPU: 1 out of 150 Xeon Gold cores (22 cores total)  
- GPU: NVIDIA Tesla P100

## Requirements

The following Python libraries need to be installed beforehand:

- numpy==1.23.4
- pandas==1.5.1
- scikit-learn==1.1.3
- scipy==1.9.3
- matplotlib==3.6.2
- tensorflow==2.10.1
- keras==2.10.0
- smac==1.4.0
- optproblems==1.3
- evoalgos==1.1
- theano==1.0.5
- extra-keras-datasets==1.2.0
- pillow==9.3.0
- requests==2.28.1

> **Note:** This set of experiments is intended to work on top of a pre-existing W-EAM system.  

Three versions of W-EAM were used:

- **MNIST:** https://github.com/eam-experiments/MNIST  
- **EMNIST:** https://github.com/eam-experiments/EMNIST  
- **DIMEX:** https://github.com/eam-experiments/dimex  

---

## Usage

Scripts to run **SMS-EMOA** and **SMAC3** algorithms are available in the folders:

- /optimization_experiments/mnist 
- /optimization_experiments/emnist
- /optimization_experiments/dimex

After downloading and training any of the three mentioned versions of W-EAM, just copy
the experiment you wish to run inside the base directory of the project. 

Some slurm files to queue experiments runs are available in /slurm.

Scripts to generate plots and statistics are also available in /plotting_scripts. 

Hardcoded variables were used across all these experiments, so you should read the code
and make the necessary changes before using it.
